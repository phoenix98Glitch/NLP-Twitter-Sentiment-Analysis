# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

# In this hands-on project, we will train a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 


The tasks performed will be :

Task #1: Understand the Problem Statement and business case
Task #2: Import libraries and datasets
Task #3: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
Task #4: Plot the word cloud
Task #5: Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation
Task #6: Perform data cleaning - remove stop words
Task #7: Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
Task #8: Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
Task #9: Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers
Task #10: Train a Naive Bayes Classifier
Task #11: Assess trained model performance
