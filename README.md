# NLP-Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

# In this project, we will train classifiers to predict sentiment from thousands of Twitter tweets. This project could be practically used by any company with social media presence to automatically predict customer's sentiment (i.e.: whether their customers are happy or not). The process could be done automatically without having humans manually review thousands of tweets and customer reviews. 


>>> The tasks performed will be :

1. Understand the Problem Statement and business case
2. Import libraries and datasets
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis
4. Plot the word cloud
5. Perform data cleaning - removing punctuation
6. Perform data cleaning - remove stop words
7. Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization)
8. Create a pipeline to remove stop-words, punctuation, and perform tokenization
9. Understand the theory and intuition behind Naive Bayes classifiers

# Trained a Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, XGBoost Model, ensembled all 3 models and assessed their model performance.
